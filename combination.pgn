{ In a combination, you normally only use active moves: checks, captures, various attacking moves or threats. In this lesson, it is precisely these active possibilities on which you should be concentrating. Special attention needs to be paid to the first moves.  A. Alekhine – V. Mikenas, Kemeri 1937   In the game, Black played:  1...Bxe4?!  And obtained just a small advantage.  Instead Black could have played the combination... }

{ In order to achieve the goal of the combination, you often have to accept temporary material losses. When this is the case, you should not break off your calculation of lines too soon. The position can only be evaluated when there are no more active moves left.  In the examples which follow, we shall see once more how important the active moves are. Try to attack the opposing pieces!  J. Capablanca – A. Alekhine, World Ch, Buenos Aires  (1)  1927  (Variation from the game) }
1... Qc7 2. Rf8 { If  2.Qb3  Qxb8  3.Qxf7+  , then  3...Kh6–+  escapes the checks.   2.Ra8  would not be good, on account of  2...Qc6–+  , with an attack on the rook and also the threat of  Re1+. } 2... Kg7 3.
