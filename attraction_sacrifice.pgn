{ Attraction tactics, often referred to as ‘decoys’, are all about luring an enemy piece, usually through sacrifice, to a specific square on the chessboard, in order to unleash a further tactic on that piece.   The most common examples of attraction include:   1. Luring an enemy piece into a winning pin, fork, or skewer   2. Luring the enemy king to set up a forced mate  The following elegant study by the classic French composer, Henri Rinck, demonstrates a number of nice examples of the attraction motif.   Through a series of 'lures', White is eventually available to win Black's queen: }
1. Ra8 { A powerful move. Black's queen can't take the rook in view of Bf3+, but also has a hard time finding a square that doesn't lead to an immediate pin/skewer for White. } 1... Qa2 { The only safe square, it seems. Other tries lose immediately:   1...Qxa8  2.Bf3++-   1...Qe6  2.Ra6++-   1...Qd5  2.Bf3+-   1...Qc4  2.Rc8++-   1...Qh7  Also appears safe at first glance, but loses for the same reason as we'll see in the main line. } 2. Rxa4 { Setting up another winning skewer.   2.Be8+?  doesn't work after  2...Kb6  3.Rxa4  Qe6  and Black is fine. } 2... Qg8 { Once again the only safe square.   2...Qxa4  3.Be8+  is another winning skewer. } 3. Ra8 { The rook returns to a8 @@StartBracket@@again if Qxa8 then Bf3+ wins@@EndBracket@@, but this time Black's queen does not have the a2-square available. Instead, Black's queen is forced to go to h7: } 3... Qh7 { Finally the queen is forced to go to this square. This time, it's the bishop that delivers the fatal attraction: } 4. Bg6 { The queen is trapped and forced into a losing skewer. } 4... Qxg6 5. Ra6+ { White finally wins the queen and with it the game.   The main way to develop one’s ability to find these kinds of tactics is through consistent practice, which means solving lots of puzzles on this theme.   This chapter includes a number of relatively simple examples that should build up your pattern recognition when it comes to spotting this motif.   Make sure to first attempt each puzzle yourself  (think for up to 5 minutes)  before checking the solution, and then carefully review any problems you get wrong. Good luck! } *
